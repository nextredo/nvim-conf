# NVIM Config

TODO reintroduce autocomplete again
TODO turn on neovim news.txt

## Goals for this config
- Minimal, but makes nvim an IDE rather than just an editor
- Change as few mappings as possible (unless they're really dumb ones)

## Some TODO's
- [ ] Make this repo not a fork
- [ ] Eventually be able to open the files from `:Telescope planets` in their full glory
- [ ] Spellcheck pls
- [ ] Deselect current search on esc
- [ ] Stuff in [`plugins/README.md`](./lua/wizards/plugins/README.md)

### Low priority
- [ ] Move LSP custom configs into the `lsp/` directory
- [ ] Floating text (end of line) for LSP diagnostics
